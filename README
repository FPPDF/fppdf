Readme (under construction) for fixpar_nnpdf code

Requires NNPDF code from https://docs.nnpdf.science either from source or conda

```
    conda install nnpdf -c https://packages.nnpdf.science/conda -c conda-forge
```

To run simply execute:

python fixpar_nnpdf.py --config=configs/**.yaml

for the corresponding .yaml file. Some explanation of the various flags is provided in the example .yaml files but clearly this needs better documentation + some specific example cases to be provided.

The outputs are in the outputs/ folder:

/evgrids  : the output pdf grids which can then be evolved using the NNPDF evolution (to be tided/documented)
/buffer : outputs from running code
/cov : covariance matrix (used for error calculation)
/evscans: outputs if eigenvector scan is done
/pars : the PDF parameters

Readme (under construction) for fixpar_nnpdf code

Requires NNPDF code from https://docs.nnpdf.science either from source or conda

```
    conda install nnpdf -c https://packages.nnpdf.science/conda -c conda-forge
```

To run simply execute:

```
python fixpar_nnpdf.py <runcard>.yaml
```

for the corresponding .yaml file. Some explanation of the various flags is provided in the example .yaml files but clearly this needs better documentation + some specific example cases to be provided. Adding to this, to run:

- A fixed chi^2 output. Set fixpar to False. 
- A fit. Set fixpar to True. The second column of 0/1's in the input file (in input/) specify whether a given parmeter is free (1) or fixed (0). If all are fixed this will be as if fixpar is set to True. The parameters for the best fit will be output to outputs/pars/$label.dat and the covariance matrix to outputs/cov/$label.dat.
- An eigenvector scan. Set readcov to True, with the 'cov input file' given by the output of a previous fit. Then specify if dynamic tolerance is used (dynamic_tol) and if not the size of the fixed tolerance (t2_err).

The outputs are in the outputs/ folder:

/evgrids  : the output pdf grids which can then be evolved using the NNPDF evolution (to be tided/documented)
/buffer : outputs from running code
/cov : covariance matrix (used for error calculation)
/evscans: outputs if eigenvector scan is done
/pars : the PDF parameters

# Step-by-step fit

0. (only in the case of missing higher order uncertainties in the covariance matrix)

Run the following command to prepare the run and compute the theory covariance matrix.
```
fixpar_setupfit <runcard.yml>
```

1. Perform the minimization.

This procedure might take some hours.
```
fixpar_fitpdf <runcard.yml>
```

2. Compute the hessian error members.

Once the fit has finished, used the fit parameters found in the previous step to compute the hessian error members using the chosen prescription.
```
fixpar_hessianerr <runcard.yml>
```

3. Evolve and create the final grid.

Once the PDF set at the initial scale has been computed, evolve it to generate a full LHAPDF grid for all scales.
```
fixpar_evolve <runcard.yml>
```
